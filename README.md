### **Aim:**
The aim of this project is to study about credit risk in commercial banks and build machine learning models that will be used by credit analysts to identify and predict loan defaults with the intention of assisting them in better decision making and evaluating the profile of potential borrowers whilst minimizing future credit default risk and preventing the recurrence of the global financial crisis. 

### **Objectives:**
1. To perform data pre-processing and data exploration to extract information and understand the relationships between the features in the dataset. 
2. To build supervised machine learning models of different algorithms to predict loan default.
3. To evaluate the results and uncover the best machine learning model with the highest accuracy which can accurately classify the risk of loan default. 
4. To deploy fully trained machine learning model in the web application and incorporate explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to generate a report.
